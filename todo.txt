Build & dev tools
==========================================
- running development on minified files is cool (early integration) but then it is hard (impossible?) to debug...
- would be great if we could have a dev mode where minification wouldn't be required

Application
==========================================
- app-level

- general problems to solve
    - code duplication among CRUD controllers
    - show spinner and wait for data/response before route changes
    - add warning before delete
    - filtering & sorting
    - validation

- admin projects
    - finish with users in projects
